LIST:
Python lists are containers to store a set of values of any data type.
A list can be indexed just like a string.

LIST METHODS:
Consider the following list:
l1 = [1,8,7,2,21,15]
• l1.sort(): updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
• l1.reverse(): updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
• l1.append(8): adds 8 at the end of the list
• l1.insert(3,8): This will add 8 at 3 index
• l1.pop(2): Will delete element at index 2 and return its value.
• l1.remove(21): Will remove 21 from the list.
TUPLES IN PYTHON:
A tuple is an immutable data type in python.
a = () # empty tuple
a = (1,) # tuple with only one element needs a comma
a = (1,7,2) # tuple with more than one element
TUPLE METHODS:
Consider the following tuple:
a = (1, 7, 2)
• a.count (1): a count (1) will return number of times 1 occurs in a.
• a.index (1) will return the index of first occurrence of 1 in a.
