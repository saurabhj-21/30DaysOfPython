#How do you prevent a python print() function to print a new line at the end.

#The print function in Python automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output.

print("Hello, World!", end=" ") # This will print "Hello, World!" without a newline at the end.  
print("This is on the same line.") # This will print on the same line as the previous print statement.
