DICTIONARY:
Dictionary is a collection of keys-value pairs.
a = {
"key": "value",
"saurabh": "code",
"marks": "100",
"list": [1, 2, 9]
}
print(a["key"]) # Output: "value"
print(a["list"]) # Output: [1, 2, 9]

PROPERTIES OF PYTHON DICTIONARIES
1. It is unordered.
2. It is mutable.
3. It is indexed.
4. Cannot contain duplicate keys.

DICTIONARY METHODS
- .items(): Returns a list of (key,value)tuples.
- .keys(): Returns a list containing dictionary's keys.
- .update({"friends":}): Updates the dictionary with supplied key-value pairs.
- .get("name"): Returns the value of the specified keys

SETS IN PYTHON.
Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.
s = set() # no repetition allowed!
s.add(1)
s.add(2) # or set ={1,2}

PROPERTIES OF SETS
1. Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter
2. Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index
3. There is no way to change items in sets.
4. Sets cannot contain duplicate values.
OPERATIONS ON SETS
Consider the following set:
s = {1,8,2,3}
• len(s): Returns 4, the length of the set
• s.remove(8): Updates the set s and removes 8 from s.
• s.pop(): Removes an arbitrary element from the set and return the element
removed.
• s.clear():empties the set s.
• s.union({8,11}): Returns a new set with all items from both sets. {1,8,2,3,11}.
• s.intersection({8,11}): Return a set which contains only item in both sets {8}.
